/**

 * @brief Race Application Server
 *
 * The Race Application Server is the main class used for the reception of the packets
 * produced by the race sensors. Packets are received on the LoRa receiver, a packet forwarder
 * then creates a json and sends it through a socket as an udp datagram. This class
 * listens on this socket, retrieves the udp packet, decodes it and extracts the json string
 * using various classes. After the json string is extracted, the data inside is pushed to
 * the database.
 *
 * Semtech's packet forwarder (https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder)
 * was used as a base to develop this class, in particular the util_sink application.
 *
 * @hallard Single channel gateway (https://github.com/hallard/single_chan_pkt_fwd) implementation was also
 * used as a base (in particular the rapidjson usage for the configuration)
